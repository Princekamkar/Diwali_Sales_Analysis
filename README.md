Data Analytics Project – Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Cleaning

This project demonstrates a complete data analytics workflow using Python. It includes loading a dataset, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaning and preprocessing the data, and extracting meaningful insights.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analysis skills, including data handling, visualization, and problem-solving using industry-standard tools.


Key Contributions & Impact
  • Performed comprehensive data cleaning and manipulation, including handling missing values,       removing duplicates, correcting data types, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
  • Conducted detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to      uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.
  • Improved customer experience insights by identifying high-potential customer segments across     different states, occupations, gender, and age groups, enabling more targeted marketing          strategies.
  • Improved sales strategy and inventory planning by identifying the most selling product           categories and top-performing products, helping align stock levels with customer demand.
